HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2: What's the Difference?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol that powers the web. It is a way for clients (web browsers) to request resources from servers (web hosts). 
HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP, but it has some limitations that can impact performance. HTTP/2 is a newer version of HTTP that addresses these limitations 
and offers significant performance improvements.

Here are some of the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

Multiplexing: 

HTTP/1.1 can only send one request at a time per TCP connection. This means that if a web page loads multiple resources, each resource will have to wait for the previous
resource to finish before it can start downloading. HTTP/2, on the other hand, can send multiple requests at the same time over a single TCP connection. This eliminates the need for resources 
to wait for each other, which can significantly improve performance.

Header compression: 

HTTP/1.1 headers are sent in plain text, which can add unnecessary overhead. HTTP/2 uses a more efficient header compression algorithm, which can reduce the size of headers by up to 70%. 
This can also improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred.

Server push:

HTTP/1.1 requires clients to explicitly request resources from servers. HTTP/2, on the other hand, allows servers to push resources to clients. This can improve performance by reducing the 
number of round trips that need to be made between clients and servers.
In general, HTTP/2 offers significant performance improvements over HTTP/1.1. However, not all web servers and browsers support HTTP/2 yet.

Here are some of the benefits of using HTTP/2:

Faster page load times: 

HTTP/2 can significantly reduce page load times by reducing the number of round trips that need to be made between clients and servers.
Improved performance for streaming media: HTTP/2 is well-suited for streaming media, such as video and audio. This is because HTTP/2 can efficiently multiplex multiple streams of data 
over a single TCP connection.

Reduced bandwidth usage: 

HTTP/2 can reduce bandwidth usage by compressing headers and eliminating the need for multiple round trips.
If you are looking to improve the performance of your website, you should consider using HTTP/2. However, it is important to check that your web server and browser support HTTP/2 
before you make the switch.
